  <p><b>About the artist</b></p>
  <p className="mt-2">
  Elizabeth Kezia Widjaja is an Indonesian-born and raised artist and photographer. Her rebellious visuals draw from computer programming, which naturally galvanized a photographerâ€™s control down to every single pixel. Through her works, she constantly plays with the deconstruction of media, sharing her findings online.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  She is a recipient of British Fashion Council's NEW WAVE 2022. Her works have been featured in Lane Crawford, MING'S, PhotoVogue, CAP 74024, SchÃ¶n Magazine, YeP YeP, DEW Magazine, Ã€PART Publications, and more.
